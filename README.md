# Regional Attention with Architecture-Rebuilt 3D Network for RGB-D Gesture Recognition (RAAR3DNet)

Folder Network_Search is the code for rebuilding the I3D network. We rebuild the network architecture based on PC-DARTS to search for a strong baseline network. Here, we have implemented a multi-GPU-based network search method, which greatly improves the search efficiency.
